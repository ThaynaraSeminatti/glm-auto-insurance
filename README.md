# Generalized Linear Models for Auto Insurance
## Introduction


Insurance pricing is a complex process involving the analysis of various factors to determine the appropriate value of policies, balancing risk for the insurer and affordability for policyholders. In this context, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) emerge as a fundamental statistical approach. They are widely utilized in the insurance industry due to their ability to handle a variety of data types, accommodate non-normal distributions, and incorporate different types of relationships between independent and dependent variables, all while being easily interpretable.

## Objective

"This study was developed based on the book 'Generalized Linear Models for Insurance Rating,' as part of the Insurance Pricing discipline. Its objective is to make predictions for severity (average cost of claims) and claim frequency using data related to the Palio 1.0 vehicle in the year 2020. The focus is on exploring multiple models of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to identify the one that best fits the data and the study's objectives."
